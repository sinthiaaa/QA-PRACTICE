# Q1| You have a shoe-selling e-commerce platform. Now, the client wants to implement a new feature "Search". During the client meeting, they mentioned they wanted to make the search dynamic, with any keywords, or specific text. Now you have a chance to get into more details on the feature. You can ask 10 questions to the client. List the questions according to priority.



# Q2|Write down the test cases according to your questions.



# Q3|Let's say, your development team implemented the feature on the  Evershop site 
``` bash
    git clone https://demo.evershop.io/ 
```

Now execute your test case into the URL and generate a report.



# Q4|Now there is a happy path journey for searching with the text “Nike react phantom run flyknit 2”. Add a couple of small-sized black products to your cart. Then verify the Cart. Now execute the journeys from both API and UI. Now provide feedback on your test analysis, keep logs of the defects, and generate a report.


 


# NOTE: 

If you find any bug keep track on Google Drive with proper naming convention, and keep the URL in your test case file.

For the API test, export the collection and share the file.
